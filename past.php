                                    the research of our former director
                                    Mr.Ravinthiran. His paper content is very
                                    useful to the society because it says how to
                                    manage electricity using solar system. I think
                                    that the experts could be improved more
                                    because our Director General’s theme is
                                    prosperity through research and development.
                                    I specially thank the Director General for giving such a wonderful event to SLIATE. This is the
                                    first symposium in the history of SLIATE. This should be continued maintaining the same
                                    standard like this. On the other hand I specially thank the organizing committee and Mr. Lal
                                    Shantha, Director-ATI-Colombo for the arrangements and accommodation”</p>

                                    effective. The participants were very
                                    talented but I think research should be
                                    effective for the future generation. The
                                    most important thing is that the research
                                    should be applicable to the national and
                                    global development”. Further, Mr.
                                    Rupasinghe mentioned that the researches should be more focused on eradicating the pollution
                                    and he appreciated the research based on solar power which was presented in the engineering
                                    session. Concluding his feedback he appreciated the organizing committee for selecting an ideal
                                    location for the symposium.</p>

                                    SLIATE. I think SLIATE has formed a new

                                    researches and academic activities. This

                                    honor our Director General. As I am in the
                                    Head Office, I know in his vision he always
                                    discussed about this symposium. It is
                                    appreciable that within his busy schedule he
                                    has allocated time for this event. Because of his advice, guidance and assistance we experience
                                    this important event. We are gaining the new knowledge. This is a major tool for the
                                    development of SLIATE. Therefore, we must thank Dr. Hilary E. Silva for giving us this
                                    opportunity. I observed almost all the presentations and I appreciate the English department.
                                    Their presentations were very interesting. I must thank the organizing committee as this event is
                                    organized in an international level”</p>

                                <p>“This was a dream of Dr. Hilary Silva
                                    because this was started in 2014. I think we
                                    were trying to do a symposium at that time.
                                    There were so many barriers. Anyhow he
                                    started the forum at least in 2017 and that is
                                    his effort. SLIATE was started in 1997 and
                                    we never ever thought about this sort of
                                    forum and the research culture. So the
                                    lecturers who presented today are very lucky. This is a very good initiative. I think we can
                                    develop and get a very good place par with the university. There are lots of talented lecturers
                                    among us. So, I feel it is a very good start and everything is well organized”. </p>
